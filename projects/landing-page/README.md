## Project Ideas

The project's main idea is letting us (the students) get more familiar with the DOM, work with JS , dynamically create Elements and update them.

The project has 6 sections and 6 menu items are dynamically built in the navigation bar. The selected section is highlighted as well as the navigation menu connected to it.
